## üöÄ About Me

Backend software developer and data scientist with a strong foundation in application prototyping, data ETL pipelines and data analysis, ML pipelines and RAG systems. 

My background in academic experimental research has honed my ability to methodically investigate complex problems, design systematic approaches to testing hypotheses, and draw meaningful insights from data. Through my role as full-stack Senior Data Scientist, I've developed expertise in prototyping innovative ML based and data-driven solutions, validating and evaluating business ideas and supporting the productization of successful prototypes. 

I have been writing Python code for a decade, and have built RESTful API backend systems using different frameworks (Django, FastAPI) and various SQL flavors (PostgreSQL, SQLite). I have experience with CI/CD and cloud hosting solutions (AWS, GCP). Over the past year I am really enjoying writing Go code.
