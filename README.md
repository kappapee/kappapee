## 🚀 About Me

Experienced software developer with 10+ years of hands-on experience building full-stack ML applications, API backend services, and production-ready prototypes. 
Strong foundation in experimental research methodology, statistical analysis, and systematic hypothesis testing developed through academic research and applied in fast-paced innovation environments.

Expertise spans the complete development lifecycle: from ETL data pipeline architecture and API design (FastAPI/Flask) to service deployment and cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) with CI/CD automation. 
Proficient in Python and Go, with growing passion for security-oriented engineering practices. 
Focus on developing innovative AI solutions including LLM-powered applications, RAG systems, agentic AI services and predictive modeling.

Proven track record in leading cross-functional research teams, managing international collaborations, and delivering production ready services. 
Skilled in rapid prototyping, user validation, and translating complex business requirements into scalable technical solutions.

## 💼 Experience

### Technology Consultant
**Freelance** Athens, Greece | *Mar 2025 - present*

Consulting services on digital and AI transformation for local small-medium enterprises and non-profit organisations. 
Developed prototypes to demonstrate and evaluate digital transformation of portfolios and AI services using Python, FastAPI, Postgres and Streamlit.

### Senior Data Scientist
**SAP** Berlin, Germany | *Apr 2021 - Feb 2025*

Senior software developer in the Research and Innovation team, responsible for de-risking MLfeatures through full-stack prototype development and user validation. 
Built production-ready PoCs using Python, FastAPI/Flask, and Streamlit deployed on Azure with CI/CD and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), as well as custom libraries and SDKs for internal use. 

Key projects:

- LLM-based service transforming natural language business process descriptions to formal business process diagrams,
- RAG system enabling tailored information retrieval for chatbots using vector databases,
- Recommendation system suggesting next actions for running business processes,
- Predictive modeling for business process outcomes.

Led user testing sessions, provided clean handovers to engineering teams with comprehensive documentation, and successfully transitioned multiple prototypes to production services.

### Data Scientist
