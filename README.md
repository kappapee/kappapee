## About me

I am a software developer who likes writing python and (lately) go.

I enjoy coding CLIs, web APIs and ML/LLM services and pipelines.

The tech stack I am experienced and comfortable with is (roughly):

- python, go, bash
- postgres, sqlite
- docker, kubernetes
- rest api, qraphql
- aws, azure
- git, github CI/CD
- a variety of python machine learning and data science frameworks and libraries

A few year ago I was leaning more on the data science aspect of development.
I transitioned more towards the machine learning engineering and backend side of things, and I am having much fun.

Previously I was a trained physicist working in labs for some years.
