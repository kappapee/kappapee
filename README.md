## üöÄ About Me

Experienced data scientist and software developer with 10+ years of hands-on experience building full-stack ML applications, backend services, and production-ready prototypes. Strong foundation in experimental research methodology, statistical analysis, and systematic hypothesis testing developed through academic research and applied in fast-paced innovation environments.

Expertise spans the complete development lifecycle: from data pipeline architecture and feature engineering to ML model deployment, API development (FastAPI/Django), and cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) with CI/CD automation. Proficient in Python and Go, with growing passion for backend development and security-oriented engineering practices. Focus on developing innovative AI solutions including LLM-powered applications, RAG systems, and predictive modeling.

Proven track record in leading cross-functional research teams, managing international collaborations, and delivering clean handovers to production engineering teams. Skilled in rapid prototyping, user validation, and translating complex business requirements into scalable technical solutions. Currently expanding expertise in software architecture principles and security engineering to transition toward more production-focused development roles.

## üíº Experience

### Technology Consultant
**Freelance** Athens, Greece | *Mar 2025 - present*

Cunsulting services on digital and AI transformation for local small enterprises and non-profit organisations. Developed prototypes to demonstrate and evaluate digital transformation of portfolios and AI services using Python, FastAPI APIs, Postgres and Streamlit.

### Senior Data Scientist
**SAP** Berlin, Germany | *Apr 2021 - Feb 2025*

Senior data scientist in the Research and Innovation team, responsible for de-risking ML ideas through full-stack prototype development and user validation. Built production-ready PoCs using Python, FastAPI/Django APIs, custom libraries, and ETL pipelines deployed on Azure with CI/CD and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes). Key projects:

- LLM-based service transforming natural language process descriptions to formal business process diagrams,
- RAG system enabling tailored information retrieval for chatbots using vector databases,
- Recommendation system suggesting next actions for running business processes,
- Predictive modeling for business process outcomes.

Led user testing sessions, provided clean handovers to engineering teams with comprehensive documentation, and successfully transitioned multiple prototypes to production services. 

### Data Scientist
**Signavio** Berlin, Germany | *Mar 2020 - Mar 2021*

Data scientist in the Research and Innovation team, focused on developing ML prototypes and proof-of-concept applications to validate new product ideas. Built full-stack applications using Python, custom libraries, and REST APIs (FastAPI/Django) with cloud deployment using CI/CD pipelines and containerization. Key projects:

- Time-series anomaly detection system for process mining applications,
- Automated insights generation from business process data mining,
- Custom quality index for process model evaluation and optimization.

Conducted user testing sessions to validate prototypes and collaborated with engineering teams on successful project handovers, providing robust documentation and clean codebases for production implementation.
