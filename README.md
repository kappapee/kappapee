## üöÄ About Me

Experienced researcher and data scientist with a strong foundation in experimental research, data analysis, and emerging technologies, now transitioning into cybersecurity research and analysis. With over a decade of research experience spanning quantum physics, machine learning, and data science, I aim to bring my analytical mindset and problem-solving skills to cybersecurity challenges.

My background in experimental research has honed my ability to methodically investigate complex problems, design systematic approaches to testing hypotheses, and draw meaningful insights from data. Through my role as Senior Data Scientist at SAP Signavio, I've developed expertise in prototyping innovative solutions and evaluating emerging technologies. I am currently expanding my technical skillset in cybersecurity through hands-on learning in penetration testing methodologies and advanced and secure backend development.
