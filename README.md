## üöÄ About Me

Experienced researcher, data scientist and software developer with a strong foundation in experimental research, data analysis, backend development and emerging artificial intelligence technologies. 

My background in experimental research has honed my ability to methodically investigate complex problems, design systematic approaches to testing hypotheses, and draw meaningful insights from data. Through my role as Senior Data Scientist at SAP Signavio, I've developed expertise in prototyping innovative solutions (including machine learning pipelines and backend services) and evaluating emerging technologies. 

I am currently expanding my technical skillset in secure-oriented backend development through hands-on learning on the boot.dev and tryhackme.com platforms, including topics on OOP, functional programming, web servers, SQL databases, CI/CD, data structures and algorithms. 

I have been writing Python code for many years, and I am really enjoying writing Go code over the last year.
